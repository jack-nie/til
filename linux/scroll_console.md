See as though this is not easily possible: The [Arch Linux Wiki][1] lists no way to do this on the console (while easily possible on the virtual terminal). 

You could use [tmux scrolling][2]:

> <kbd>Ctrl</kbd>-<kbd>b</kbd> then <kbd>[</kbd> then you can use your normal navigation keys to scroll around (eg. <kbd>Up Arrow</kbd> or <kbd>PgDn</kbd>). Press <kbd>q</kbd> to quit scroll mode.

> Alternatively you can press <kbd>Ctrl</kbd>-<kbd>b</kbd> <kbd>PgUp</kbd> to go directly into copy mode and scroll one page up (which is what it sounds like you will want most of the time)

for gnome-terminal:

Use <kbd>Shift</kbd>+<kbd>Page Up</kbd> and <kbd>Shift</kbd>+<kbd>Page Down</kbd>.

If you want to scroll line by line, you can use 

>Control+Shift+Up/Down Arrows.
